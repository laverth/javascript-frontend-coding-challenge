If I had more than 4h to work on this, I'd implement:

- Caching the search results for optimization and to be used when a request gets a 403 and alerting the user it's cached data.

- Pagination (infinite scrolling). Not showing only the {numOfResults} first elements. It should more items when the user's reaching the end of the results list. 

- Error handling.
